#Hello, I'm SYED AMJAD 👋
I am a Strategic Business & Data Analyst and a specialist in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science. My focus is on leveraging predictive modeling and complex data engineering to drive critical operational efficiency and strategic business outcomes, particularly within high-stakes environments like Airlines Engineering and Supply chain Operations.
🌟 Featured Project: ProAOG Predictive System
ProAOG is a critical, high-impact predictive modeling application designed to minimize operational downtime and associated costs for airlines.
This is a self-initiated capstone project leveraging deep domain expertise in aviation engineering to solve the industry's most costly problem: **Aircraft On Ground (AOG) events.**
🌟Category	
	      Detail 
 *Business Impact
	Reduces critical aircraft delays by 15% (target) by enabling preemptive resource and personnel deployment.
 *Core Integration
	Generates high-confidence alerts that integrate directly with Passenger & Flight Operations for scheduling adjustments, and feeds MRO recommendations to Maintenance & Engineering teams.
 *Technology Stack
	Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Streamlit), Predictive Algorithms, SQL, Git/GitHub.

 *Model Architecture
	Designing a modular LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture to process complex, high-frequency time-series sensor data.
 *Optimization Target
	Achieve a reliable 72-hour prediction window for component failure.

 *Focus Systems
	Predicting degradation within modern fleet components: Boeing 787 /777APU and Airbus A380 /A350 EHA Actuators.

🚀 Key Operational Features
The ProAOG platform is designed to seamlessly integrate data intelligence into critical aviation workflows:
•	AOG Forecasting (Predictive Alerts): Provides a 72-hour lead time on high-risk component degradation using time-series LSTM models, enabling proactive intervention before failure occurs.
•	Passenger & Flight Operations Integration: High-confidence failure alerts are pushed directly to scheduling teams to preemptively adjust flight assignments, minimizing passenger disruption and logistical chaos.
•	⚙️ Maintenance & Engineering Workflow: Automatically generates MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) recommendations, optimizing labor scheduling, inventory management, and technician deployment.
🛠️ Core Skills
•	Data Analysis & ML: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statistical Modeling, Power BI, Tableau, LSTM Networks.
•	Business Strategy: Digital Transformation, Business Process Re-engineering, Six Sigma, Requirements Elicitation.
•	Databases & Tools: SQL, Firestore, Streamlit, Git/GitHub.
